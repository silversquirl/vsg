# vsg

A tiny static site generator.

## What?

vsg is a static site generator I originally wrote for
[vIRC's website][virc-site]. It is now planned to be used for the next
version of [Torbay Tech Jam's][ttj] website as well.

## Why?

There are loads of static site generators out there. Why write another?

The simple answer is that I find all of them a pain to use. They're
either too restrictive or require huge amounts of effort to set up. Some
of them are so complex that they even come with their own bootstrapping
scripts!

If I want to create a website, I don't want to spend time setting up the
program that's supposed to make things easier for me. vsg requires a
couple of configuration directives (written in Python), a template
(written in Python) and directory containing Markdown files. No complex
setup, no interactive bootstrap scripts, no arbitrary templating
restrictions. Just Python and Markdown.
